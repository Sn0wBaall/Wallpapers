This repository takes wallpapers from [gh0stzk](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles), and other wallpapers from this page https://wallpapercave.com

After cloning the repository we will see that inside there are several files, among them there will be a script called **setup.sh** that will move the wallpapers folder to our desktop as shown in the image:
